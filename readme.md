# HELLO WORLD
### A readme file for something no one ought ever to look at. 

Seriously, **you should go away**, there is nothing here that is worth your time, _at all_. 

This readme file exists because

* I find markdown to be kinda interesting.
* Seriously, I had no idea this has existed for 16 years!?
* I'm a little baffled why *.md files won't open in my browser properly. 
* It's part of the homework for this thing I'm kinda halfassedly doing. 

_{I'm curious what writing text in this format will do. Is it a comment?}_

*{Is THIS a comment?}*
